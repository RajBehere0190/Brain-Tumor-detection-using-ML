## Overview
Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions requiring early detection for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques to automate and improve diagnostic accuracy.  
The solution includes:  
- Preprocessing MRI image datasets for optimal model performance.  
- Building a CNN architecture tailored for brain tumor classification.  
- Deploying the trained model with a user-friendly Streamlit app.
